# Deepin icon theme for community
This folder contains the source code of the icons sets mentioned and ready to use in Deepin:
* Marea
* Halo
* Halo Dark
* MaterialW
* Windows Comunity

## Description
Icon sets are focused on usage and experience. Most of them were made by amateurs and we explain below:

* [Marea](https://github.com/deepin-espanol/Marea): Initially used for Cinnamon, Tide uses a circular, simple and fresh interface to each icon.
* [Halo](https://github.com/deepin-espanol/Halo-icons): Halo (not to be confused with a character from a game franchise), adapts the style of MacOS. Inspired by Keefer Rourke's work, La Capitane.
* MaterialW: Google's Material Design and Moderna UI in this pack.
* Windows Comunity: To encourage the migration from Windows to Deepin, using the original icons (non-profit used).
